# Financial Forecasting Frontier – Distributed Machine Learning

## Overview
**Financial Forecasting Frontier – Distributed ML** is a distributed machine learning project focused on scalable financial data processing, predictive modeling, and real-time analytics using **Apache Spark** and **PySpark**. The project demonstrates how large-scale banking and financial datasets can be efficiently handled using data parallelism, distributed model training, and streaming analytics.

## Project Background
Modern banking and financial institutions deal with massive volumes of transactional and customer data. Traditional single-machine processing struggles with scalability, latency, and performance. Distributed machine learning frameworks such as **Apache Spark** enable efficient parallel data processing, faster model training, and real-time insights.

This project explores distributed ML techniques to improve:
- Financial forecasting accuracy  
- Data processing efficiency  
- Real-time transaction analysis
